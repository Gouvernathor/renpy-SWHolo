# renpy-SWHolo
A way to display images (or other displayables) with a star wars-styled hologram effect, including tint, transparency, blinking and interlacing effects.

The `holo.rpy` file contains the code itself.

The `script.rpy` file contains an example as to how to use it.

All 6 parameters' default values are defined in the beginning of the file and are editable.
The tint color, the height and the relative transparency of the interlaced lines, and the overall transparency are customizable for each separate instance of the effect.
The blinking frequency and the blinking transparency are common and cannot be customized for every single use of the effect.
